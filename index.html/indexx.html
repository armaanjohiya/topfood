    <p><b><H3> about food</H3></b></p>
            <p>Food is more than just sustenance; it’s a universal language that brings people together. Each dish tells a story, reflecting the culture, history, and traditions of its origin. From the vibrant spices of Indian curries to the delicate flavors of Japanese sushi, food showcases the diversity of human creativity. In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainability, with many chefs and home cooks prioritizing locally sourced ingredients and plant-based options. This shift not only promotes health but also fosters a deeper connection to the environment. Whether it’s a cozy family meal or a festive gathering, food has the power to create memories, spark conversations, and celebrate life’s moments.</p>

                            <lI> 1/2 cup water (adjust to the consistency you prefer)</lI>
                                <lI>1 tbsp sugar (optional, but adds balance)</lI>

                                        <p><b><big>instructions</big></b></p>
<P><big><b>step 1:</b> marinate the chicken</big></P>
<ol>
    
    <li>Combine the marinade ingredients: In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, cumin powder, and salt.</li>
    
    <lI>Coat the chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour (preferably in the fridge). If you have more time, marinating overnight will enhance the flavor.</lI>
</ol>
<P><big><b>step 2:</b> cook the chicken</big></P>
<ol>
    <Li>Grill Method: Preheat a grill or grill pan and cook the marinated chicken until it's cooked through and slightly charred (about 8–10 minutes).</Li>
    
    <lI>Pan-Fry Method: Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium-high heat and cook the marinated chicken until browned and cooked through (about 8–10 minutes). Set aside.</lI>
</ol>
<p><big><b>step 3:</b> prepare the gravy</big></p>

<Ol>
    <lI>Heat butter and oil: In a large pan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.</lI>
    
    <lI>Cook onions: Add the chopped onions and sauté until golden brown, around 5-7 minutes.</lI>
    
    <li>Add ginger-garlic paste: Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for another 2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
    
    <li>Tomato puree: Add the pureed tomatoes and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the oil starts to separate from the tomato mixture.</li>
    
    <li>Spices: Add red chili powder, garam masala, cumin powder, and coriander powder. Stir well and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
    
    <li>Add cream and sugar: Lower the heat and add the heavy cream and sugar. Stir well, letting it simmer for a few minutes until the gravy becomes smooth and creamy.</li>
    
    <li>Add water: Adjust the consistency by adding water, depending on how thick you want the gravy. Let it simmer for 5–10 minutes.</li>
</Ol>
<p><big><b>step 4:</b> Combine Chicken with Gravy</big></p>

<ol>
    <LI>Add the cooked chicken: Add the grilled or pan-fried chicken pieces to the gravy. Stir gently to coat the chicken with the sauce.</LI>
    
    <li>Simmer: Let the chicken simmer in the gravy for about 5–10 minutes, so it absorbs the flavors of the sauce.</li>
    
    <li>Final touch: Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and stir until it melts into the sauce. This will give the curry its signature richness and shine.</li>
    <br>
</ol>
<p><big><b>step 5:</b> Garnish and Serve</big></p>
<ol>
    <li>Garnish: Sprinkle chopped fresh cilantro on top of the butter chicken.</li>
    
    <li>Serve: Serve the butter chicken hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice. You can also serve it with a side of cucumber raita or a simple salad.</li>
    
</ol>
<p><h3>Tips for the Perfect Butter Chicken:</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li>Yogurt in the marinade: Yogurt tenderizes the chicken and helps in infusing flavors. Make sure you use plain, unsweetened yogurt.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Smoky flavor: To add a smoky flavor (like the one in restaurant-style butter chicken), you can use the "dhungar" method. Heat a piece of charcoal until it’s red hot, place it in a small bowl, and pour a teaspoon of ghee or oil over it. Cover the pan immediately to trap the smoke and let it infuse for 5–10 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <lI>Butter: Use plenty of butter for richness. It’s a key ingredient that gives the dish its signature smooth, velvety texture.</lI>
    <br>
    <li>Adjust the spice level: If you prefer a milder butter chicken, reduce the amount of chili powder and use less garam masala.</li>
